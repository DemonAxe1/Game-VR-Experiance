<h2>Description</h2>
This is hardware using an Arduino to create a VR controller system. Movement is tracked by a mechanical treadmill,
important game buttons are mapped to finger controls that are located on the left hand, 
and the mouse movement is simulated using a WII controller with a script that makes it act exactly like a mouse.
The biggest part is the headset, which uses another Arduino that mainly works with a gyroscope that calculates movement and rotation
so simulate mouse movement. This is extremely useful when the player in Wizard101 or Pirate101 is in fake first person
(this is achieved by walking backward in game till the character is out of view and then holding down the mouse button)
When fake first-person is combined with the simulated mouse movement of the gyroscope this simulates camera and body movement 
in the game. This means that the user walking on the treadmill can move around the world by just turning his head left and 
right. The user can also look up and down by looking up and down with the hardware on.

The Arduino board controls the playerâ€™s movement when the player is in VR. This connects to a gyroscope (only using ground, power, SDA, and SCL connections) and a toggle switch on the other side of the headset: <br/>

This picture shows all the connections on the Arduino board that control all the movement, turning left and right, interaction buttons, and Fake FP macro toggle:  <br/>

This is a backup shot showing how the touch sensors are mounted onto the fingers of the user, and how the cables rout out of the Arduino box: <br/>
